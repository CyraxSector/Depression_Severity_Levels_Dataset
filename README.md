# Depression Severity Levels Dataset
The official corpus - initial version for "HelaDepDet: A Novel Multi-Class Classification Model for Detecting the Severity of Human Depression" paper under the ongoing research work "The Correlation between Group Text Chat Behavior and Severity of Human Depression"

This is an aggregated dataset of publicly available corpora for human depression severity categorization. The categorization has been conducted considering BDI-3 and Depression Severity Annotation Schema as the ground truth.

The respective depression severity class and BDI-3 scale can be tabulated as follows:

| Depression Severity Class     | BDI-3 Score       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Minimal      | 0-9 |
| Mild      | 10-18      |
| Moderate | 19-29      |
| Severe | 30-63      |

The corpus file consists with two columns and the class distribution can be revealed as follows:

| Depression Severity Class     | Count           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Minimal      | 10,549 |
| Mild      | 10,661      |
| Moderate | 9,473      |
