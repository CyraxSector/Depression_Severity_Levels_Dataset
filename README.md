# Depression Severity Levels Dataset
The official corpus - initial version for "HelaDepDet: A Novel Multi-Class Classification Model for Detecting the Severity of Human Depression" paper under the ongoing research work "The Correlation between Group Text Chat Behavior and Severity of Human Depression"

This is an aggregated dataset of publicly available corpora for human depression severity categorization. The categorization has been conducted considering BDI-3 and Depression Severity Annotation Schema (DSAS) as the ground truth.

The respective depression severity class and BDI-3 scale can be tabulated as follows:

| Depression Severity Class     | BDI-3 Score       |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Minimal      | 0-9 |
| Mild      | 10-18      |
| Moderate | 19-29      |
| Severe | 30-63      |

The corpus file consists with two columns and the class distribution can be revealed as follows:

| Depression Severity Class     | Count           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Minimal      | 10,549 |
| Mild      | 10,661      |
| Moderate | 9,473      |
| Severe | 11,176      |

Further, the depression lexicon which has been introduced by Cha, Kim and Park 2022 will be used for further enhancements and the lexicon can be listed down as follows.

| DSAS Criteria     | Lexicon           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day      | sadness, anger, bored, hurt, nervousness, moody, emotional |
| Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in activities most of the day, nearly every day      | discomfort, unhappy, no-focus,disturbed      |
